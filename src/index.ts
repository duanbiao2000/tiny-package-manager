/**
 * Welcome to learning about how to build a package manager.
 * In this guide I will tell you how to build a
 * very very simple package manager like npm or Yarn.
 *
 * I will use ES2017 syntax in this guide,
 * so please make sure you know about it.
 *
 * Also this guide is written in TypeScript.
 * Don't worry if you don't know TypeScript,
 * just treat it as JavaScript with some type annotations.
 * If you have learned Flow, that's great,
 * because they are similar.
 *
 * To make this guide as simple as possible,
 * I haven't handled some edge cases.
 *
 * Good luck and let's start!   :)
 *
 * This is just the main file of the whole tiny package manager,
 * but not all of the logic,
 * because I split them into different modules and files for better management.
